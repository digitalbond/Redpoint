description = [[
Enumerates Siemens S7 PLC Devices and collects their device information. This NSE is based off PLCScan
that was developed by Positive Research and Scadastrangelove (https://code.google.com/p/plcscan/). This 
script is meant to provide the same functionality as PLCScan inside of NMAP. Some of the information that is 
collected by PLCScan was not ported over to this NSE, this information can be parsed out of the packets that are received. 

Thanks to Positive Research, and Dmitry Efanov for creating PLCScan
